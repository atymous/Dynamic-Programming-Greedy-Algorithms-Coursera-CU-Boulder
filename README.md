# Dynamic-Programming-Greedy-Algorithms-Coursera-CU-Boulder
My personal study repo for a course on divide and conquer algorithms. I’m using it to collect my quiz answers, programming assignments, and experiments with algorithms like Karatsuba multiplication, Strassen’s algorithm, FFTs, and closest-pair-of-points.
